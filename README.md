npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```

## Development

# Start app

```bash

# Start the server in one terminal
node server.js

# Hot reload front end in another terminal
npm run dev

```
